# CAD: handheld enclosure, sensor head, demo conveyor

| Folder | What is in it |
|--------|---------------|
| `print/` | STL files, already in print orientation |
| `files/` | Fusion archives (`.f3d`), STEP exports, and the parametric Fusion build scripts |

`effente-cad.stl` is an earlier enclosure export, kept for reference. Print the files in `print/` instead.

## Rebuilding

Run `files/build_enclosure.py` or `files/build_conveyor.py` in Fusion (Utilities > Scripts and Add-Ins). Every size is a parameter at the top of the script. Each run builds a new design and prints clash checks. Values marked UNVERIFIED in the scripts are typical or listing sizes, not measurements: measure the real parts before printing.

## What to print

One of each. Material PETG or PLA, except the belt.

| Plate | File | Infill | Supports |
|-------|------|--------|----------|
| 1 | `conveyor_frame.stl` | 15-20% gyroid, 4 walls | Off |
| 1 | `conveyor_drive_roller.stl` | 4 walls + 20% gyroid, upright, brim | On, build plate only |
| 1 | `conveyor_idle_roller.stl` | 4 walls + 20% gyroid, upright, brim | On, build plate only |
| 1 | `conveyor_motor_bracket.stl` | 100% | Off |
| 1 | `device_sensor_head.stl` | 100% | Off |
| 1 | `device_head_lid.stl` | 100% | Off |
| 1 | `device_imu_cradle.stl` | 100% | Off |
| 1 | `device_screen_tray.stl` | 15-20%, 4 walls | Off |
| 2 | `device_back_shell.stl` | 15-20%, 4 walls | Off |
| 2 | `device_front_lid.stl` | 15-20%, 4 walls | Off |
| 3 | `conveyor_belt_TPU.stl` | TPU, vase mode | Off |

Print the drive roller first and check it fits the TT motor shaft.

## Not yet measured

TT motor shaft and gearbox, button cap height, OLED board size, MPU board size, and the height of the sockets under the UNO Q. See the UNVERIFIED notes in each script.
